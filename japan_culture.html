              The origin of the Japanese language is heavily debated. Evidence could link several language families,
              including Chinese, Polynesian, and Ural-Altaic. Many even consider Japanese to be a language isolate! Yet
              it is most widely believed that the Japan language belongs to the Ryukyuan family of languages, brought to
              Japan via the Korean peninsula in the 4th century BC.<br>The Modern Japanese period moves further from the
              origin of the Japanese language. Previously, the Kansai dialect of Japanese was considered the language
              standard. But in the Modern Japanese era, there was a shift towards the dialect spoken in Edo (modern-day
              Tokyo). From the 1600s onwards, the city developed into the largest in Japan, and the regional language
              variety was used to speak Japanese professionally and day-to-day.<br>Japanese is often considered a
              language isolate, as the origin of the Japanese language cannot be traced to any other language family.
              However, one related language is Korean. The Korean language and the Japanese language have significant
              differences in pronunciation, but both use honorifics. In the Japan language, this is known as Keigo (敬語),
              translating literally to “respectful language.”</p>

              Religion in Japan is manifested primarily in Shinto and in Buddhism, the two main faiths, which Japanese
              people often practice simultaneously. According to estimates, as many as 70% of the populace follow Shinto
              rituals to some degree, worshiping ancestors and spirits at domestic altars and public shrines. An almost
              equally high number is reported[6] as Buddhist. Syncretic combinations of both, known generally as
              shinbutsu-shūgō, are common; they represented Japan's dominant religion before the rise of State Shinto in
              the 19th century.<br>

              The Japanese concept of religion differs significantly from that of Western culture. Spirituality and
              worship are highly eclectic; rites and practices, often associated with well-being and worldly benefits,
              are of primary concern, while doctrines and beliefs garner minor attention. Religious affiliation is an
              alien notion. Although the vast majority of Japanese citizens follow Shinto, only some 3% identify as
              Shinto in surveys, because the term is understood to imply membership of organized Shinto sects.
              Some identify as "without religion" (無宗教, mushūkyō), yet this does not signify rejection or apathy towards
              faith. The mushūkyō is a specified identity, which is used mostly to affirm regular, "normal" religiosity
              while rejecting affiliation with distinct movements perceived as foreign or extreme.</p>

              Japanese calligraphy, rendered using flowing, brush-drawn strokes, is considered to be a traditional art
              form, as well as a means of conveying written information. Typical calligraphic works can consist of
              phrases, poems, stories, or even characters represented by themselves; the style and format of the
              calligraphy can mimic the subject matter through aspects such as the texture of the writing and the speed
              of the brush strokes. Several different styles of Japanese calligraphy exist, with considerable effort put
              into the outcome; in some cases, it can take over one hundred attempts to produce the desired result of a
              single character. This form of calligraphy is known as shodō (書道), literally meaning 'the way of writing
              or calligraphy', or more commonly, shūji (習字), 'learning how to write characters'. Commonly confused with
              calligraphy is the art form of sumi-e (墨絵), literally meaning 'ink painting', which is the art of painting
              a scene or object using diluted black ink.<br>
              Painting has been an art in Japan for a very long time: the brush is a traditional writing and painting
              tool, and the extension of that to its use as an artist's tool was probably natural. Japanese painters are
              often categorized by what they painted, as most of them constrained themselves solely to subjects such as
              animals, landscapes, or figures. Chinese papermaking was introduced to Japan around the 7th century.
              Later, washi was developed from it. Native Japanese painting techniques are still in use today, as well as
              techniques adopted from continental Asia and from the West. Schools of painting such as the Kano school of
              the 16th century became known for their bold brush strokes and contrast between light and dark, especially
              after Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu began to use this style. Famous Japanese painters include Kanō
              Sanraku, Maruyama Ōkyo, and Tani Bunchō.</p>

              The kimono is the national garment of Japan, having developed from Chinese court clothing in the Nara
              period following the exchange of diplomatic envoys between the two countries at that time. The word kimono
              translates literally as 'thing to wear on the shoulders'; however, this term developed some time around
              the Edo period, before which most kimono-like garments were referred to as the kosode ('short sleeve'),
              with longer-sleeved garments being known as furisode ('swinging sleeve').

              The earliest versions of the kimono were heavily influenced by traditional Chinese clothing, known today
              as hanfu (kanfuku (漢服) in Japanese). This influence was spread through Japanese envoy missions to China,
              resulting in extensive Chinese cultural adoption by Japan as early as the 5th century CE.[41] It was
              during the 8th century, however, that Chinese fashions came fully into style, and following the
              cancellation of the 20th mission to Tang dynasty China, these fashions developed independently, with the
              overlapping, V-shaped collar becoming women's fashion and the precursor to the modern kimono
            <br>Kimono, alongside all other items of traditional Japanese clothing, are known collectively as wafuku, meaning 'Japanese clothing', as opposed to yōfuku, Western-style clothing. Kimono come in a variety of colors, styles, and sizes. Men mainly wear darker or more muted colors, while women tend to wear brighter colors and pastels, and, especially for younger women, often with complicated abstract or floral patterns.
